<br/>🍎 Lets you share (mainly naturally growing) food to others
<br/>🍒 Intended to use in the local area - zoom in to your location and look for entries
<br/>🍐 The main idea is to share to and help other people by e.g. sharing pears, which would rot anyway if unused
<br/>🌽 Everyone can add entries (and delete them), no login needed
<br/>🍇 Entries will be available 60 days
<br/>🍅 Available in 16 languages and more to come
